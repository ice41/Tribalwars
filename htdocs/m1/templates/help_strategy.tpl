<h3>Basic Strategy</h3>

<p>DSLan is a game of both tactics and strategy. Unlike most other war games, DSLan is not just a game of brute strength and tactical skill. Wise micro and macro management are critical to success.</p>

<b>1. Invest your resources more efficiently than your opponent</b>
<p>In early game, this is most crucial. You need to get off to a fast start. This means that there is no need to upgrade any building that will not provide massive returns. Upgrading your resource buildings, warehouse, and farm are essential. Anything else should be carefully considered. Will you actually use a market at this point, or will you just waste your resources? Realize that resources are far more valuable early on than later. Later on, you'll have more resources than you can spend, and it'll be easy to upgrade a market. But early on, your money is better spent going towards a resource building upgrade.</b>

<b>2. A good balance between economy and defense will free you from micromanagement, freeing you up to focus on an offensive.</b>
